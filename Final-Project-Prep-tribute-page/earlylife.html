			<p>Rabbi Ovadia Yosef was born in Baghdad, Ottoman Iraq, to Yaakov Ben Ovadia and his wife, Gorgia. In 1924, when he was four years old, he immigrated to Jerusalem, with his family. In Israel, the family adopted the surname "Ovadia". Later in life, He changed his surname to be his middle name, "Yosef", to avoid the confusion of being called "Ovadia Ovadia".</p>

			<p>The family settled in the Beit Yisrael neighborhood of Jerusalem, where Yaakov operated a grocery store. The family was poor, and the young Ovadia was forced to work at a young age. He learned in Talmud Torah B'nei Zion in the Bukharim quarter, where his passion and skill for Torah study was apparent. His literary career began already at age 9, with a commentary on Reshit Chochmah, which he penned in the margins.</p>

			<p>In 1933, Hakham Sadqa Hussein prevailed upon Yaakov to send his son to Porat Yosef Yeshiva. He soon advanced to the highest shiur taught by the rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Ezra Attiya.</p>
