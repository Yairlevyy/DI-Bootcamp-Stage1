			<p style="font-size:25px;">RESTORING THE PAST GLORY
			</p>
		</div>


		<div class="container">
			<p>Rabbi Ovadia Yosef frequently made use of the slogan "Restore past glory" as a metaphor embodying both his social and halakhic agenda. <br><br>

On a social level, it is widely viewed as a call to pursue a political agenda that will restore the pride of the Mizrahi Jews (Jews from the Middle East) in Israeli society, which historically suffered from discrimination.<br><br>

From a halakhic perspective, the metaphor is more complex. It is widely agreed by Rabbis and secular researchers alike that the 'crown' of the metaphor refers to the halakhic supremacy which he attaches to the rulings of Rabbi Yosef Karo. According to his approach,Rabbi Yosef Karo is crowned as the Mara D'Atra of the Land of Israel, and thus all Jews living within his realm of authority should be bound by his rulings.Rabbi Ovadia Yosef says this explicitly and in very strong terms in Yalkut Yosef (note that 'Maran' refers to Rabbi Yosef Karo):<br><br>

Even if a hundred acharonim disagree with him...no teacher is permitted to rule with chumra contrary to Maran's instructions to rule leniently, even if many disagree with Maran...and it is not even permitted to act with chumra where Maran has ruled leniently on the matter, since the rulings of Maran, who is the Mara D'Atra and we have received his instructions, were determined as Halakha to Moses at Sinai over which there is no dispute, and he who deviates right or left dishonours his teachers.

			<p style="font-size: 25px;">"THE GROWTH OF CHUMROT LEADS TO LENIENCY IN THE BODY OF THE TORAH" <em>(Yabia Omer)</em>
			</p>

		<div class="container">
			<p>He adopted the Talmudic dictum that, "The power of leniency is greater". Therefore, one of his fundamental principles of halakhic ruling is that lenient rulings should be preferred over chumra. He saw this as one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Sephardic approach to Halakha, compared to the Ashkenazi approach. In one of his rulings, he quoted Rabbi Chaim Joseph David Azulai as saying:<br><br>

The Sephardim are characterized by the quality of kindness, and therefore are lenient in the Halakha, and the Ashkenazim are characterized by the quality of power, and therefore they rule strictly.<br><br>

He considered this principle an ideal, so that if one is asked (a question) on a ritual-halakhic matter and succeeds in proving that a lenient position is a correct one from a halakhic standpoint, he sees this as a positive achievement.<br><br>

In Rabbi Ovadia Yosef's opinion, the severity of Ashkenazi poskim results from their method of teaching, and a lack of familiarity with the Mishnah, Talmud and poskim. In a 1970 article he wrote about Rabbi Jacob Saul Elyashar, he says:<br><br>

But since they (the Ashkenazim) are cautious in their teaching, they do not (bravely) rule halakha l'ma'aseh ('practical halakha'), especially on matters of new developments or new technologies which create halakhic problems, it is far from them to be interested and express their view of Daat Torah...Our Rabbi the Gaon Jacob Saul Elyashar was among those few virtuous ones who took upon themselves this burden to resolve the actual problems of his time, and among them are some which are relevant to this day, and he did not avoid answering his questioner...<br><br>

He regarded ruling with severity as especially harmful in the current generation ("the generation of freedom and liberty"), since strict ruling might lead individuals not to comply with the Halakha. Writing in Yabia Omer, he says: "And truly, the growth of chumrot leads to leniency in the body of the Torah."
